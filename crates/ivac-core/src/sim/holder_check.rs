//! Per-segment holder-vs-wall collision check. The cutting flutes can
//! clear a deep narrow pocket while the shank or holder above them
//! still slams into the un-cut wall sticking up around the flutes. This
//! pass walks the segment's swept XY footprint inflated by the holder's
//! max radius, and per cell asks: is the wall standing at this cell
//! taller than the height at which the holder envelope grows past the
//! cell's radial offset from the cutter axis?
//!
//! Signs / frames:
//! * `cutter_pz_at_t` — Z of the cutting tip along the segment.
//! * Cell stores `cell_z` — the lowest Z the heightmap reached at that
//!   cell. `cell_z > cutter_pz_at_t` means the wall there is taller
//!   than the tip is deep, i.e. there's `cell_z - cutter_pz_at_t` mm of
//!   wall above the tip.
//! * Holder envelope at radial offset `r`: lowest `z_above_tip` where
//!   `radius_at(z_above_tip) >= r`. If that height is *less* than the
//!   wall height above the tip, the holder hits — and the required
//!   clearance is `wall_height - holder_lower_z`.
